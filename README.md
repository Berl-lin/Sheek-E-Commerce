# SheeK E-Commerce Website

By Christabell Owusu[Github](https://github.com/Berl-lin)
 This project is a requirement to complete my ALX Programme - The final project.

## Project Description - Why Sheek?

In Ghana, a major challenge most people face is investing in quality goods. There is this wierd believe that "second hand' products are "the best". Hence most people would purchase these items over brand new ones. The incentivising factors include;
- Fear of buying fake products or imitations
- Non-durable products, due to poor quality
- Very few verified legit sources to purchase these items.
- Shipped products become too expensive to purchase.
- Lack of trust in online shops because of fears of being scammed or frauded.

Regardless of all these, perspectives are shifting in favour of mobile technology usage.The e-commerce numbers are surging and this is just the beginning - at least for Africa.

SheeK's goal is to provide a safe virtual store for all major brands in the world. Upsides include;
- Products and price comparisons
- Able to budget 
- Convenience.

 So, as a developer, I went with the E-commerce concept to lay the foundation for an application that may change the lives of many.

N.B: The work is done focusing on just the Frontend - No Backend.
